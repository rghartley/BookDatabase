## Book Database API

This repository contains:

- A sample api that contains CRUD endpoints for books and authors, complete with a Dockerfile
- A console app that calls endpoints on the api and outputs the results

For simplicity, the repositories are implemented using in-memory persistence and there is no data integrity validation.
